# git in git
Following along @escodebar's presentation.

Slides are here: https://escodebar.github.io/talks/techtalkthursday/#/

## Motivation
Get out of more situations where before you'd just delete and pull again.

## When am I in the inner repository?
When XZibit is shown :-)

## Branches
Just a pointer to a specific commit.

## Why not check in large files?
You change one byte - it gets the full file again.
